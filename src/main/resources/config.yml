#                        Made by: Filip 'filipeex' Karab
#             Fully customisable pinata plugin, for completely free.


# This peace of colored text called a 'prefix', is put before every message.
# If you don't want to have any prefix, you can just leave this as is, and edit every message in your respected lang file.
prefix: '&#FB4A58&lᴘ&#FA4179&li&#F9389B&lɴ&#F92FBC&lᴀ&#F826DE&lт&#F71DFF&lᴀ &8〣&r'

# What language should the plugin use?
# You can see all the available languages in the 'languages/' folder.
# You can then edit all the messages in a file with a name like this: 'lang_EN.yml' (replace EN with your language).
language: 'EN'

# What location should the pinata spawn at by default?
# You can create locations with /pinata location add <name> - the location will be created at your player location.
# When a console executes a command like /pinata spawn, with no specified location,
# this location will be used to spawn a pinata.
spawn_location: ''

# How many votes do we need to spawn a pinata?
# If you wish to not spawn the pinata automatically when the vote counter reaches this number,
# you can just set this number to -1
# In the case that you want to use this feature, in your vote-handling plugin, set it up so
# every time a player votes, console executes the command /pinata votes add 1 - which increases the vote counter.
votes_needed: 32

# When the vote goal is reached, how many pinatas should be spawned?
# Beware: if you set this number too high, you might experience TPS drops (server lag).
spawn_amount: 1

# If a player tries to hit the pinata with any of these items, they'll get an error message in chat.
# If you don't need this, just set this option up like so: 'item_blacklist: {}'
item_blacklist:
  - BARRIER
  - COMMAND_BLOCK

# If you want, you can set up a list of items, which the player would have to use to hit the pinata.
# If you need to, fill up the list with whitelisted items, and then switch the option 'use_item_whitelist' to true.
use_item_whitelist: false
item_whitelist:
  - TOTEM_OF_UNDYING

# You can choose weather to summon fireworks when the pinata dies.
# Below, you can also decide on how many of them should spawn.
# Each firework is offset by 3 ticks (150ms), and spawns in a random location around the dead pinata.
spawn_fireworks: true
firework_amount: 10

# Should we check for a permission before allowing a player to hit the pinata for rewards?
# If so, you can choose which one.
use_hit_permission: false
hit_permission: 'fpinata.allowhit'

# When any of these events listed below happen, the plugin will go through all the commands,
# and for each one, it will roll a dice with the set chance (%) of rolling a "yes", when a "yes" is rolled,
# the command is executed. Feel free to play around with these, it's fun.
# These can also be useful for integration w/ other plugins.
# In all of these, you can use the PlaceholderAPI placeholders, and they should be replaced with no problem.

# This is run per-player who touched the pinata.
# You can use the 'global: true' option, to run this command only once, and not for every player.
